# The project outline
The Little Lemon restaurant has built a menu application for its customers. It has a list of all the products provided by their main branch. Currently, customers can only browse the list, but can’t sort, search or filter it. Therefore, there’s considerable room to improve the user experience. Little Lemon wants you to implement these features in the existing app. The user interface for the app is already built, you now have to provide the implementation for sorting, searching and filtering products, as well as opening the product details screen.
